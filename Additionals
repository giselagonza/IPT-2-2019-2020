Hellow Gisela!
got interested in your Machine Learning thing.... Want to be of help whenever you need it!!

lets:
import help from people

help.request(anything_you_want)

if help.available:
    # will try to solve
elif help.unavailable:
    # will checkout other people
else:
    # that will never happen
    pass


print("lot's of love from Sanga Emanuel A, your bro at Manzese")
